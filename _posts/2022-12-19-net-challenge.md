## What is Net Challenge?
In summary, Net Challenge is a contest about network configuration and troubleshooting hosted by the faculty of Computer Network and Communication in UIT. For more details about it, you can read [here](https://www.uit.edu.vn/net-challenge-2022-chinh-thuc-mo-dang-ky).
Me being a Network student had to participate just for the knowledge alone, *not even for the prize money*. So, my two roommates and one 3rd year student formed a team and registered under the name **Xelvis64**.
And so, the story begins.
## Qualifying round
The first round of the contest was a multiple choice test with around **30 questions** (I'm not sure about this). All the questions were about computer networking and *you were allowed to Google*. We had **60 minutes** to complete and each member of the team was **forbidden of communicating** with each other. It did sound rather hard at first, but with the help of Google, things became a little bit easier.
Only the **top 10 teams** with the **highest scores** would be qualified for the next round. Guess what, our score was terrible but somehow, we ranked **10th** and thus, were qualified!
## Semi-finale
No more trivia questions, it's time for some actual configuration to be done. Each team was handed a set of papers and on them were the challenge for this round. To be continued...
