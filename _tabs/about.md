## About this site
You are viewing my personal website for posting blogs as well as projects or any of my achievements. Aside from that, occasionally, I write content about specific subjects I took at my university for the sole purpose of learning and sharing. The language on this web page could be either Vietnamese or English, I'm too lazy to make a language switcher so there's that.

I'm not a web developer so I like to keep this site as simple as possible in terms of functionality and UI design. The Jekyll theme I'm using is [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) with a bit of customization from my side and the whole thing is running on the GitHub Pages platform. The GitHub repository for this website can be found [here](https://github.com/thu4n/thu4n.github.io).
