A list of projects that I took part in.

### Trackr
A basic Winforms desktop application built for tracking delivery packages. The goal for this project was for me to learn HTTP handling processes during the Network Application course at my uni. It was developed with its own server and database hosted on Azure, but of course, all of which were removed because keeping them running would cost a lot of money.

#### WiFi Sensing System with ESP32 and Jetson Nano
A scientific research oriented project in which I deployed a wireless embedded network system for human activities recognitions through CSI signal data in WiFi captured by the ESP32 microcontrollers and processed by the Jetson Nano Developer Kit platform. The system also involved an MQTT broker and an Android application to integrate interaction with end users.

### AirQA
An Android application that monitors and visualize the air quality and other related informations, built with Java. All APIs except for the map were provided by my lecturer during the Mobile App course at my uni. My contribution to this project is handling all the APIs related logic as well as core functionalities required for the course.

### Study Vault of UIT

A community project where we stored all learning materials that we gathered during our university courses and shared them via a public website. The website is hosted on GitHub pages and uses the Jekyll theme of JustTheDocs with a bit of customization of our own. My involvement in the project is maintaining the site and providing my own study materials.
